All right, so I'm back in high school. I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I'm totally naked. Then I look down, and I realize there is a phone... There! All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me. Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very-very weird because, she never calls me!
